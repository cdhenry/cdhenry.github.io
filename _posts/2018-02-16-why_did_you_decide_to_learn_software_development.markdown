I decided to learn software development, because I'm interested in talking to computers.  

I'm interested in all kinds of communication, really, but there's a lot of opportunity and innovation around what people are asking computers to do and how they're responding.  It excites me.

So, that's the long and short of 'why I decided', but ‘why I stick around’ is because I love puzzles.  I love spending all day trying to crack a really difficult problem, and I love the way my dreams get all twisted if I can't find a solution by the end of the day.  With almost predictable certainty, the practice of coding stumbles me into a flowstate I can't quite replicate with any other activity (maybe solving math problems?).  What's more strange is that when I reflect upon the past decade of my life, there's very little that might have pointed me in this direction.

I've been an actor immersed in the power of language, the voice, the body, and storytelling.  I've been focused on the kind of collaborative creativity that can only come from bodies in space colliding in dramatic scenarios; emotional alchemy with very few hard and fast rules, requiring loads of experimentation, and giving way to a unique kind of communal catharsis: crying and laughing with complete strangers.  When I tell my friends and colleagues what I've been doing (coding) they're utterly confounded, and I was too at first.

I kept wondering why the ritual I’d been engaged with since I’d gone to college was losing its luster.  Why was I giving up all I had worked for to stay at home and read books about *Java*?  Why had I been turning down really good parts to go take calculus classes at the local city college?  I’m not going to lie; it’s still somewhat of a mystery to me, but I do know I’ve never felt more at home than I do now.  I remember hearing once that in order to build character a person should pursue what challenges them, and in order to build a career one should pursue what they’re good at.  I think that’s the best possible frame for where I’ve been and where I’m going: I’ve been building character; now it’s time to build a career.  

There’s something very right about coding.  When I’m learning, the concepts just seem to stick.  It’s not always easy, but work was never so void of willful effort when I was acting.  The journey was absolutely necessary.  I cracked many shells (some I didn’t even know I had), and I experienced the world with a bare-nerve-ending level of sensitivity.  Those challenges gave me more access to an invaluable language and intuition regarding my own inner life and the diverse perspectives of people around me.  These ‘soft’-er skills will inevitably serve me in the future, but now it’s time to catch back up to the rest of the pack.

That’s why I’m coding, that’s why a ‘bootcamp’.  I can’t wait to join this tribe I’m sure I’ll love.
