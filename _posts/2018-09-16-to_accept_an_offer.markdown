This week got bogarted by my first in-person interview for a software development position, so instead of doing a post on the challenges I faced trying to update my website/portfolio projects, as I'd initially hoped, I can only write about how the interview process consumed me and about the questions that arose after an offer was made.

Primarily, I have to recognize how lucky I am to have received an offer.  I understand how tough the market is for an associate level developer, especially if, like myself, up until now the experiences on your resume offer little proof of purchase in the realm of computer science.  At the forefront of my mind is gratitude, and then ... in floods the uncertainty.

For a little context, I began my job search about three weeks ago, and have been dutifully sending off applications, cover letters and resumes, getting in touch with recruiters via LinkedIn, and networking with the small community of developers I currently know.  This interview came through Flatiron directly.  Periodically, their business development and career services team will reach out with opportunities that fit your interests once you graduate the program.  These leads have all been very interesting and felt more fruitful than the cold outreach I've made to recruiters on my own.  It's the first and only interview I've gone on, so I have little over which to compare the company or the offer.  There are more interviews coming near the beginning of October, but the company is unwilling to hold a seat that long.  I'll have to make a decision soon, and what follows are some of the questions I'm asking.

*** As I wrote this blog post, I began to recognize that there is one core question, and I've enumerated it below.  My other questions revolve around 'What's the growth plan,' and 'Will I like your people' headers, but without anything to compare it to there's only one question that really matters at this point.

### Is it important to go on more than one interview?

[In his recent TED Talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/tom_griffiths_3_ways_to_make_better_decisions_by_thinking_like_a_computer) Tom Griffiths asks how to make better decisions and uses his background in computational cognitive science to find solutions.  He gives an example of the dilemma many people have when they are in the market for a new apartment or house.  How long should you search and when should you make an offer?  The simple answer, much like the simple solution to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything (re: [Hitchhikers Guide...](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy)), is an integer: 37.

> If you want to maximize the probability that you find the very best place, you should look at 37 percent of what's on the market, and then make an offer on the next place you see, which is better than anything that you've seen so far. Or if you're looking for a month, take 37 percent of that time -- 11 days, to set a standard -- and then you're ready to act.

This is an example of an [optimal stopping problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimal_stopping), and I think there are elements of my dilemma that hold true to this construct.  I'm in the market for a new job.  I want to make sure the job has certain qualities (ie. is a place where I can learn a lot and be frequently challenged, is working with relevant technologies, and where there exists a structure for senior engineers to mentor new hires), and there is an enormous market with limited time to move on certain options.  However, there are differences to the real estate market in that it's not as simple as seeing a place and making an offer.  Just to get to the point where I will have this decision I must do several rounds of interviews and be made an offer by someone else.  If I'm to use this formula, somehow I'd have put in place some hypotheticals, like how many offers I'm likely to get and what the range of benefits those offers might include.  All that is way over my head, so I'm relying heavily on those who have gone before me - this is where I hope someone on the team at Flatiron can step in and lend some sound advice.  

Another such probabilistic notion that may help color my decision is the [explore/exploit problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit).  

> The explore/exploit trade-off shows up any time you have to choose between trying something new and going with something that you already know is pretty good, whether it's listening to music or trying to decide who you're going to spend time with. It's also the problem that technology companies face when they're trying to do something like decide what ad to show on a web page. Should they show a new ad and learn something about it, or should they show you an ad that they already know there's a good chance you're going to click on?

If I frame this moment as an explore/exploit problem, I could say that I don't really know what's out there, and I don't have any strong preferences; so it might be more advantageous to explore at this moment.  Perhaps, that's what makes the interview process so valuable as a job seeker: you'll get to experience a taste of many companies and get a sense for what directions interest you most.  Then again, perhaps the real exploring begins once you are in a role, and it could be seen as advantageous just to get that first job going.  That way there will be some baseline for opportunities in the future.  (Feeling a little like Chidi on the Good Place right now)

People are notoriously bad at knowing what will make them happy in the future, and I'm no anomaly.  This is one of the things that draws me to computer science, math, and a job as a programmer in the first place.  I want to be a part of helping people make better decisions.

In addition to TED Talks, I've tried to reach out to friends and fellow programmers, some have been congratulatory and think it's a great place to start; others have said that they think the job search is important, and any company that isn't willing to wait a few weeks might not really value the potential employee all that much in the first place.

Hopefully, this little excursion into an envious problem to have has been helpful.  Because it's highly likely that you'll be weighing the options of a significant life change soon, I thought sharing the vulnerability of this moment might be affirmational in some way.
